INCLUDE_PATTERNS=(
    # "Documents/*"
    # "Pictures/*"
    # "*.pdf"

# Files/directories matching these patterns will be excluded from backups
# Examples:
#   - "*.tmp" excludes all temporary files
#   - ".cache/" excludes the .cache directory
#   - "node_modules/" excludes node_modules directories

    # Common directories to exclude
    ".cache/"

    # "node_modules/"
    # "__pycache__/"

# INCLUDE_PATTERNS=(
#     "Documents/*"
#     "Pictures/*"

# Backup everything except large/temporary files:
