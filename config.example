# Source directory to backup (default: $HOME)
SOURCE_DIR="$HOME"

# Destination directory for backups (default: $HOME/.qbkp/data)
BACKUP_DIR="$HOME/.qbkp/data"

# Number of backups to retain (default: 7)
# The system will automatically delete old backups when this limit is exceeded
# Minimum of 2 backups will always be kept for safety, even if this is set lower
# Example: RETENTION_COUNT=10  # Keep 10 most recent backups
RETENTION_COUNT=7

# Ntfy.sh topic for notifications (optional)
# If set, backup status notifications will be sent to ntfy.sh

# Example: NTFY_TOPIC="my-backup-alerts-xyz123"
# Leave empty or comment out to disable notifications
NTFY_TOPIC=""

# Include patterns (bash array syntax)
# If any include patterns are specified, only matching files will be backed up
# Examples:
#   - "*.txt" matches all .txt files
#   - "Documents/*" matches everything in the Documents directory
#   - "Projects/important/*" matches everything in Projects/important/
INCLUDE_PATTERNS=(
    # "Documents/*"
    # "Pictures/*"
    # "*.pdf"
)

# Exclude patterns (bash array syntax)
# Files/directories matching these patterns will be excluded from backups
# Examples:
#   - "*.tmp" excludes all temporary files
#   - ".cache/" excludes the .cache directory
#   - "node_modules/" excludes node_modules directories
EXCLUDE_PATTERNS=(
    # Common directories to exclude
    ".cache/"
    ".npm/"
    ".local/share/Trash/"

    # Development artifacts
    # "node_modules/"
    # "__pycache__/"
    # ".git/"
    # "target/"
    # "build/"
    # "dist/"

    # Temporary files
    # "*.tmp"
    # "*.log"
    # "*.swp"
    # "*~"

# Example configurations:

# Backup only specific directories:
# INCLUDE_PATTERNS=(
#     "Documents/*"
#     "Pictures/*"
#     "Projects/*"
#     ".config/*"
# )

# Backup everything except large/temporary files:

#     "*.dmg"
#     "*.tmp"
#     ".cache/"
#     "Downloads/*"
#     "node_modules/"
